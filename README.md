BurntSushi's 2018 Advent of Code solutions
==========================================

I chose to write this year's solutions in Rust. I don't have any particularly
ambitious goals, but I am trying to write the solutions using idiomatic code.
In particular, it should not be possible for any input to cause one of the
solutions to panic.

I have not spent any time benchmarking the code.

To run a solution, `cd` into its directory and invoke the program with Cargo:

```
$ cd aoc01
$ cargo run --release < input/input.txt
```

If you have questions about the code, please open an issue and ask away!
Beginner questions are very much welcome.
